# cltk_first_steps
[IN PROGRESS...]

This repository contains my first steps with Python and the Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) for natural language processing tasks within the context of Digital Humanities.

The focus is on working with classical and medieval texts (such as Latin), using CLTK's tools for tokenization, lemmatization, POS tagging, and linguistic analysis to explore computational methods applied to historical text analysis
